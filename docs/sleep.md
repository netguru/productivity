## Why we sleep?

Matthew Walker‚Äôs book; "Why We Sleep" was a game changer for me. Whilst I‚Äôd known for a long time that sleep was important; the extent to which was unclear. Matthew puts it succinctly when he says ‚ÄúThere is not one process in the human body, (that we‚Äôre aware of) that isn‚Äôt improved by sleep‚Äù. Indeed, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (part of the WHO), concluded in 2007 that night shift work is a probable human carcinogen

Sleep loss is linked to the acceleration of a plethora of common issues, including:

* Cancer
* Diabetes & Weight Gain
* Heart Disease
* Poor fertility
* Weakened immune system
* DNA damage

But what is adequate? 8 hours (of actual sleep and not "in bed time") appears to be the minimum we should strive for. Apparently there‚Äôs a tiny % of people with DNA mutations that allow them to function well below 8 hours; but it‚Äôs a minority.

## Matthew‚Äôs Tips for Good Sleep

Below I‚Äôll summarise Matthew‚Äôs 12 key tips for good sleep:

### 1. Stick to a sleep schedule

We should aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. People generally have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Unfortunately sleeping late on weekends doesn‚Äôt make up for poor sleep during the week. If necessary, set an alarm for bedtime. Matthew emphasizes this is the #1 priority from the list; stick to a regular sleep schedule.

### 2. Don‚Äôt exercise too late in the day

Exercise is great, and we should try to exercise at least 30 minutes on most days. But try to time it no later than 2-3 hours before bed.

### 3. Avoid caffeine & nicotine

Colas, coffee, teas (that aren‚Äôt herbal) and chocolate contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. Even consuming these in the afternoon can have an affect on your sleep. Nicotine is also a mild stimulant, and smokers will often wake up earlier than they would otherwise, due to nicotine withdrawal.

* If you are somewhat addicted to coffee like I used to be. Try to stay away from it after 2pm.

### 4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed

The presence of alcohol in the body can reduce your REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep.

* It is ideal to stay away from alcohol all together. However it seems the ideal day for alcoholic drink consumption (if needed) to be Friday or Saturday to give you this extra day of good sleep before you start your work-week.

### 5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night

A lights snack before bed is okay, but a heavy meal can cause digestive issues, which interfere with sleep. Drinking too many fluids can cause frequent awakenings to urinate.

### 6. Where possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep

Some commonly prescribed heart, blood pressure or asthma medications, as well as some over the counter and herbal medicines for coughs colds or allergies can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble sleeping, it may be worth speaking to your doctor or pharmacist to see if any of the drugs you‚Äôre taking may be contributing to this. It may be possible to take them earlier in the day.

### 7. Don‚Äôt nap after 3pm

Naps are great, but taking them too late in the day can make it hard to fall asleep at night.

* I found naps to be perfect during the day (specially weekends) in this form
	* Power nap - 20 mins
	* Recovery nap - 45 mins
	* 1 Sleep cycle - 120 mins

* It seems much easier to wake up and get up the speed from a shorter nap. Last thing you want to do is to interrupt your full night sleep because you naped too long or too late during the day.


### 8. Make sure to leave time to relax before bed

It‚Äôs important to have time before bed to unwind. Try to schedule your days so that there is time to relax before bed.

* Unplug yourself (no iPads, Facebook, late laptop use) at least 30 mins before bed time
* There is no harm to read a fiction book while in bed 30 mins before desired sleep time
* It is a good time to listen an audiobook while in bed with your eyes closed or meditate for a difference

### 9. Take a hot bath before bed

The drop in body temperature after a bath may help you to feel sleepy, and the bath can help you to slow down and relax before bed.

### 10. Have a dark, cool (in temperature), gadget free bedroom

We sleep better at night if the temperature in the room is kept on the cool side. Gadgets such as mobile phones and computers can be a distraction. A comfortable mattress and pillow can set you up for a good sleep. Those with insomnia will often watch the clock, turn it away from view so you don‚Äôt have to worry about the time while trying to sleep. Use these tips to optimize your sleeping space.

* Darken your room as much as possible (up to the pitch black point)
* Use sleep mask and ear plugs if you feel like it
* Freshen the air in your bedroom (ideal with a dedicated air freshener device)
* More sophisticated bed cooling devices include ChiliPad‚Ñ¢ Cube mattress pad and ambient noise generators
* The only gadgets that are welcomed in your bedroom are the ones that help you measure your sleep quality
	* Sleep measuring wearables (i.e. Watches)
	* Phone apps like "Sleep Cycle" and "SleepWatch"

### 11. Get the right sunlight exposure

Sun exposure during the day helps us to regulate sleeping patterns. Try to get outside in the natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes per day.

### 12. Don‚Äôt stay in bed if you (really) can‚Äôt sleep

If you find yourself still in bed for more than 20 minutes, or you‚Äôre starting to get anxious in bed, get up and do something else until you feel sleepy. Anxiety whilst trying to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep.
